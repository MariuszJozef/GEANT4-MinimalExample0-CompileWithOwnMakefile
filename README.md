# GEANT4-MinimalExample0-CompileWithOwnMakefile
Instead of CMake (as used in the GEANT4 installation guide) you may prefer to use a Makefile. 

1. Step into the direcory where the file with main() function resides. (In MinimalExample1 that directory is main/).
2. At the command prompt:
   make
3. Or:
   make clean all
