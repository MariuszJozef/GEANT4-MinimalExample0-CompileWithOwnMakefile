# GEANT4-MinimalExample0-CompileWithOwnMakefile
Instead of CMake (as used in the GEANT4 installation guide) you may prefer to use a Makefile. 

1. Step into the direcory where the file with main() function resides. (In MinimalExample1 that directory is main/ and the file is Geant4-MinimalWorkingExample1.cpp).

2. At the command prompt:

   make
   
   Or:
   
   make clean all

3. Execute:

   ./Geant4-MinimalWorkingExample1
